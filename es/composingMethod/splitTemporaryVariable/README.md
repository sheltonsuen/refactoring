# Split Temporary Variable

## Motivation
If you are skimping on the number of variables inside a function and reusing them for various unrelated purposes, you are sure to encounter problems as soon as you need to make changes to the code containing the variables. You will have to recheck each case of variable use to make sure that the correct values are used.

## Mechanics
Use different variables for different values. Each variable should be responsible for only one particular thing.

1. Find the first place in the code where the variable is given a value. Here you should rename the variable with a name that corresponds to the value being assigned.

2. Use the new name instead of the old one in places where this value of the variable is used.

3. Repeat as needed for places where the variable is assigned a different value.
